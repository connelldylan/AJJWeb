  <center><span class="colored-text"><H3>In the summer of 2020, Josh was thinking about voting and how time consuming it is
    to research every candidate on the ballot. That’s when Coffeehouse was conceived. What if there was an app that put all
    of your candidates on one screen organized by the office? What if you could click on a candidate, research them, compare
    them to the other candidates, pick your favorite one, do that for every office on your ballot, then vote? Why stop there?
    Why not become the platform for democracy? He realized then that he had to make the vision reality because not only would
    it be extremely helpful for himself, it would be extremely helpful for every democratic citizen (there are 1,978,674,000 
    democratic citizens in the world).
    <br>
    <br>
    Josh then went to college and met Dylan who saw the vision right away. Together, they perfected the vision, including
    coming up with the name Coffeehouse. Historians call coffeehouses the headquarters of the American Revolution. This is where
    Americans went to engage in the national discourse, learn from their leaders, and plan the future of the country. 
    Coffeehouse will be the digital manifestation of the 18th century coffeehouse. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Josh then took a gap year to be the campaign manager for U.S. congressional candidate January Walker. He learned a lot about
    the pain points every candidate faces when trying to win office. Dylan continued to go to school and worked in door-to-door
    sales at Vivint where he learned how to create relationships and maintain them.  
    <br>
    <br>
    In April of 2023, Josh and Dylan came to the conclusion that they were ready to show the world Coffeehouse. From there, they
    met Omar, Jack, Marc, Devin, Brian and Marcus - all of whom understand Josh and Dylan’s vision and are excited to get to work
    at Coffeehouse. Thank you for reading, and I hope you are excited to join us in creating the platform for the people!
