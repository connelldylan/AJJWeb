  <center><span class="colored-text"><H3>Ever since Josh took AP Government and Politics when he was 14, 
    he has been infatuated with the revolutionary form of governing the founding fathers introduced to the world in 1787.
    He read the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Federalist and Anti-Federalist papers.
    As he started paying attention to current events, he realized that the problem in America isn’t Democrat vs. Republican
    - it’s a lack of nuance, well-formed arguments, debate, and, most importantly, a stray away from the core values of America.
    Like a company or a person, if a country strays away from its core values, it’s downhill from there. 
    <br>
    <br>
    A couple years after coming to that realization, Josh came to another realization. 
    When he was 17, he was thinking about voting and how time consuming it would be to research every candidate on the ballot.
    That’s when Coffeehouse was conceived. What if there was an app that put all of your candidates on one screen organized by
    the office? What if you could click on a candidate, research them, compare them to the other candidates, 
    pick your favorite one, do that for every office on your ballot, then vote? Why stop there?
    Why not become the platform for democracy? He realized then that he had to make the vision reality because
    not only would it be extremely helpful for himself, it would be extremely helpful for every democratic citizen 
    (there are 1,978,674,000 democratic citizens in the world). He realized this idea would increase civic participation
    and help democracies all over the world get back to their country’s core values. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Josh spent the next 3 years researching and experiencing the political and software industry. 
    He studied political science and computer science at college, managed a U.S. Congressional campaign, 
    and worked at a tech company/government contractor - all the while planning the launch of Coffeehouse. 
    <br>
    <br>
    When he was 18, he came across an article that said historians call coffeehouses the headquarters of the American Revolution.
    This is where Americans went to engage in the national discourse, learn from their leaders, 
    and plan the future of the country. When Josh read that, he knew that’s what he wanted to name the idea. 
    Coffeehouse will be the digital manifestation of the 18th century coffeehouse.
    <br>
    <br>
    In April of 2023, Josh came to the conclusion that he and the world was ready for Coffeehouse. 
    Since then, he has shared the vision with a select group of people, many of whom are on our team. 
    Thank you for reading, and I hope you are excited to join us in creating a platform for the people!
