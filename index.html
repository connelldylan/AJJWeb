          <li>When voters sign up, they will input their address. Based on their address, Coffeehouse will show the user their ballots
                for upcoming elections. Each ballot shows the polling place address as well as the election date.</li>
          <li>When a user clicks on a ballot, they will see all of their candidates organized by office. </li>
          <li>A user clicks on a candidate&apos;s profile picture to research their candidates.</li>
          <li>If a candidate is their favorite candidate, they click the button on the candidate&apos;s profile picture which will update
                the ballot screen with a sticker next to the user&apos;s favorite candidate. Once a user has a sticker next to their 
                favorite candidate for every office, they have a fully researched ballot. </li>
          <li>They can then bring their phone to their polling place and vote based on the Coffeehouse app if the precinct allows that.
                If not, the user can write down their candidates on a piece of paper, post-it, index-card, etc.</li>
      </ol>
