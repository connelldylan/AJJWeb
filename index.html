    <center><p>The Coffeehouse app empowers voters by letting them easily research their candidates through a bio, endorsements, donors, and voting history. 
        We are obsessed with creating an objective platform based on facts and letting voters hear directly from the candidate without that information being 
        changed by the media or other third parties</p></center>

    <center><H2>Our Story</H2></center>
    <Center><img src="18Coffeehouse.jpg" width="1049" height="254"></Center>
    <Center><p> Historians call Coffeehouses the headquarters of the American Revolution. This is where Americans went to talk politics and learn from their leaders. Coffeehouses played a large role in shaping the nation's political landscape.
        In 2023, Coffeehouse was founded with the goal of revolutionizing the political industry by creating a new channel connecting voters with their candidates. 
        We believe apathy from the people of America has led to the DNC, the RNC, corporations, and the bureaucracies of America to <q>...subvert the power of the 
        people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government...</q> - George Washington. We are proud Americans who are fighting to put the power of government 
        back in the people&apos;s hands. Coffeehouse will be the digital manifestation of the 18th century Coffeehouse.</p></Center>

            <ol>
                <li>When voters sign up, they will input their address. Based on their address, <br> Coffeehouse will show the user their ballots
                     for upcoming elections. <br> Each ballot shows the polling place address as well as the election date.</li>
                <li>When a user clicks on a ballot, they will see all of their candidates organized by office. </li>
                <li>A user clicks on a candidate&apos;s profile picture to research their candidates.</li>
                <li>If a candidate is their favorite candidate, they click the button on the <br> candidate&apos;s profile picture which will update
                     the ballot screen with a sticker next <br> to the user&apos;s favorite candidate. Once a candidate has a sticker next <br> to their 
                     favorite candidate for every office, they have a fully researched ballot. </li>
                <li>They can then bring their phone to their polling place and vote based <br> on the Coffeehouse app if the precinct allows that.
                     If not, the user <br> can write down their candidates on a piece of paper, post-it, index-card, etc.</li>
